<mark>Introduction:  </mark>
Qur.kz-is a website where people can connect and share their experiences.It is a kazakh version of Threads.The main idea was to make a platform for sharing and connection.
Problem Statement: <mark>
In Kazakhstan and Central Asia, there's a lack of localized, community-driven platforms where users can freely share thoughts, engage in public discussions, and connect over real-time, text-based content. Global social networks often overlook regional languages, cultural nuances, and local relevance. As a result, users feel disconnected or censored in broader platforms that don’t cater to their identity, community, or local issues.
